# Daddict
Daddict is a 2D endless side-scrolling game where the player must navigate forward while avoiding randomly scattered drugs that progressively weaken their body. Consuming drugs reduces movement speed, jump power, and darkens the screen, leading to visual distortions, hallucinations, and loss of control. As addiction worsens, the player experiences random movement delays, reversed controls, and eerie sound effects. The game features a dynamic day-night cycle, multiple endings based on player choices, and a recovery system with rare detox items or rehab zones. With procedurally generated levels, unpredictable obstacles, and immersive sound design, Daddict challenges players to resist temptation and survive as long as possible before succumbing to addiction.
